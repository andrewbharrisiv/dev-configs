# =============================================================================
# Pattern Format Guidelines
#  - A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for
#    readability.
#  - A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front
#    of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
#  - An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file
#    excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. If a negated
#    pattern matches, this will override lower precedence patterns sources. Put
#    a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a
#    literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".
#  - If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the
#    following description, but it would only find a match with a directory. In
#    other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it, but
#    will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent
#    with the way how pathspec works in general in git).
#  - If the pattern does not contain a slash /, git treats it as a shell glob
#    pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the
#    location of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree
#    if not from a .gitignore file).
#  - Otherwise, git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption
#    by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will
#    not match a / in the pathname. For example, "Documentation/*.html" matches
#    "Documentation/git.html" but not "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or
#    "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".
#  - A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, "/*.c"
#    matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".
